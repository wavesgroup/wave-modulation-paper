\begin{abstract}
Hydrodynamic modulation of short ocean surface waves by longer ambient waves is
a well-known ocean surface process that pertains to remote sensing, the
interpretation of in situ wave measurements, and numerical wave forecasting.
In this paper we revisit the early analytical work by \citeA{longuet1960changes},
as well as the more recent numerical simulations by \citeA{peureux2021unsteady},
to re-evaluate the changes in short-wave properties due to the presence of longer waves.
We present two distinct improvements to the current state of the art:
First, we derive a higher-order, non-linear solution for the short-wave wavenumber
and action density as function of the long-wave phase and steepness.
This solution suggests an increase in short-wave wavenumber by 18 and 38\% for
long-wave steepenesses of 0.1 and 0.2, respectively, compared to the original
linear solution.
It is also in close agreement with the full numerical solutions up to the
long-wave steepness of 0.25.
Second, we find that the full numerical solutions, which were previously found
to be unstable for homogeneous initial conditions, are in fact stable for more
realistic long-wave groups.
The key physical interpretation from these results is that the short waves can
indefinitely grow and steepen only in the presence of inifinite long-wave trains,
an unlikely occurence in the ocean.
\end{abstract}

\section*{Plain Language Summary}
The ocean surface is typically covered by waves of many wavelengths.
Longer waves bunch up and dilate the shorter waves, and this process is
important to consider for both the measurements and the forecasting of ocean
waves.
Although there have been analytical and numerical solutions for how the short
waves should change in the presence of longer waves, they have been simplified
and incomplete.
This paper revisits and extends these solutions to propose a more accurate
description of how the short waves should change in the presence of longer
waves.
\section{Introduction}

Short ocean surface waves are modulated by longer swell.
Following the result by \citeA{unna1941white,unna1942waves,unna1947sea},
\citeA{longuet1960changes} introduced an analytical solution for hydrodynamic
modulation of short waves by an underlying longer wave:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tau}
\widetilde{k} = k (1 + a_L k_L)
\end{equation}
where $\widetilde{k}$ and $k$ are the modulated and unmodulated wavenumbers of
short waves, respectively, and $a_L$ and $k_L$ are amplitude and wavenumber
of the long wave.

This result has been influential on the development of remote sensing of ocean
surface waves and currents \cite{keller1975microwave,hara1994hydrodynamic}
and has been used even recently \cite{peureux2021unsteady} to simulate
unsteady growth of short-waves due to longer waves.

In this study, we extend the \citeA{longuet1960changes} theory (hereafter L-HS)
to a higher-order solution following the linear wave theory, and present revised
phase-averaged estimates of short-wave properties in presence of long waves. 

\section{Governing equations}

In this paper we consider inviscid, irrotational, and incompressible flow.
In these conditions the linear (sine-like), deep-water, surface gravity waves
obey the dispersion relation:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dispersion}
\omega = \sqrt{gk} + k U
\end{equation}
where $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $g$ is the gravitational acceleration,
$k$ is the wavenumber, and $U$ is the mean advective current in the direction
of the wave propagation.
A current in the direction of the waves thus increases its absolution frequency,
wavenumber remaining unchanged.
An important limitation here is that $U$ must be slow-varying on the scales of
the wave period.
In the context of short waves riding on long waves, the mean advective current
is the horizontal near-surface orbital velocity of the long wave.

The second important relation is the conservation of wave crests:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:wave_crests}
\dfrac{\partial k}{\partial t}
+ \dfrac{\partial \omega}{\partial x}
= 0
\end{equation}
where $t$ and $x$ are time and space, respectively.
This relation states that the wavenumber must change when the frequency varies
in space.

Equations (\ref{eq:dispersion}) and (\ref{eq:wave_crests}) only describe the
evolution of the wavenumber.
To describe the evolution of the wave amplitude, we use the conservation of wave
action:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:wave_action}
\dfrac{\partial N}{\partial t}
+ \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x} \left[\left(C_g + U\right)N\right]
= 0
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the action density, and $C_g = \partial \omega / \partial k$ is the
group speed.
In deep water, the group speed is half the phase speed, so $C_g = 1/2\sqrt{g/k}$.

As the short waves ride on the surface of the long wave, defined by the elevation
$\eta_L = a_L cos{\psi}$, where $\psi = k_L x - \omega_L t$ is the long-wave phase,
they move in an accelerated reference frame and will thus experience effective
gravitational acceleration that changes in both space and time.
Inserting equation (\ref{eq:dispersion}) into (\ref{eq:wave_action}) we obtain:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:wavenumber}
\dfrac{\partial k}{\partial t}
+ \left(C_g + U\right) \dfrac{\partial k}{\partial x}
+ k \dfrac{\partial U}{\partial x}
+ \dfrac{1}{2} \sqrt{\dfrac{k}{g}} \dfrac{\partial g}{\partial x}
= 0
\end{equation}

Similarly, we expand the equation \ref{eq:wave_action} to obtain:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:wave_action2}
\dfrac{\partial N}{\partial t}
+ \left(C_g + U\right) \dfrac{\partial N}{\partial x}
+ N \dfrac{\partial U}{\partial x}
+ N \dfrac{\partial C_g}{\partial x}
= 0
\end{equation}

\section{Analytical solutions}

\subsection{Derivation of the original L-HS solution}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:wave_crests4}
\dfrac{d k}{k}
= - \dfrac{\partial U}{\partial x} dt
\end{equation}
which states that the relative contraction of short waves is largest where the
convergence of the ambient current $U$ is the largest.
For short waves riding on longer waves, the mean ambient current is the
horizontal near-surface orbital velocity of the long wave.
Rather than at the long-wave surface, L-HS took the ambient current to be the
long-wave orbital velocity at the mean water level, $z = 0$:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:U_L1}
U = a_L \omega_L \cos{\psi}
\end{equation}
where $\psi$ is the long-wave phase such that the crest is located
at $\psi = 0$.
Insert (\ref{eq:U_L1}) into (\ref{eq:wave_crests4}) to obtain:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:wave_crests5}
\dfrac{d k}{k}
= a_L k_L \omega_L \sin{\psi} dt
\end{equation}
To calculate the long-wave modulated short-wave wavenumber, integrate
(\ref{eq:wave_crests5}) from the initial time at which the short-waves
are unperturbed (at $z=0$, or $\psi=\pi/2$), to time $t$:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:wave_crests6}
\int_k^{\ \widetilde k(t)} \dfrac{d k'}{k'}
= \int_0^t a_L k_L \omega_L \sin{\psi} dt'
\end{equation}
which yields:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:k_short1}
\ \widetilde k(\psi) = k e^{a_L k_L \cos{\psi}}
\end{equation}
Approximating (\ref{eq:k_short1}) to the first-order Taylor expansion,
we obtain the original L-HS solution:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:k_short2}
\ \widetilde k(\psi) = k (1 + a_L k_L \cos{\psi})
\end{equation}
The intuitive interpretation of (\ref{eq:k_short2}) is that as the short waves
contract on the front face of the long wave, they reach maximum contraction
(highest $\ \widetilde k$) at the crest of the long wave.
As they pass to the rear face of the long wave, they get elongated and reach
minimum contraction (lowest $\ \widetilde k$) in the trough of the long wave.

\subsection{Extending the L-HS solution}

L-HS made two approximations in their solution:
First, they evaluated the advective velocity of short waves at $z = 0$
rather than the surface, $z = \eta_L$, where $\eta_L$ is the long-wave
elevation; and second, they evaluated the solution to the first order
of the Taylor expansion series.
Both of these approximations cause an underestimate of the short-wave
modulation magnitude.

To extend the L-HS solution, evaluate the advective velocity at the surface
of the long-wave:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:U_L2}
U = U_L(z=\eta) = a_L \omega_L e^{a_L k_L \cos{\psi}} \cos{\psi}
\end{equation}
and insert it into \ref{eq:wave_crests4} to obtain:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:wave_crests7}
\dfrac{dk}{k} = a_L k_L \omega_L e^{a_L k_L \cos{\psi}} \sin{\psi} dt
\end{equation}
Integrate (\ref{eq:wave_crests7}) to the same limits as we did with
(\ref{eq:wave_crests6}) to obtain:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:k_short3}
\widetilde{k}(\psi) = k e^{a_L k_L \cos{\psi} e^{a_L k_L \cos{\psi}}}
\end{equation}

We compare the solutions from (\ref{eq:k_short1}), (\ref{eq:k_short2}),
and (\ref{eq:k_short3}) for a moderately steep long wave with steepness
$a_L k_L = 0.2$ in Fig. (\ref{fig:wavenumber_modulation}).
The original L-HS solution is a cosine wave with an amplitude equal
to the long-wave steepness.
The other two solutions both introduce an increase in wave modulation
on the crest and a decrease in the trough.
At the crest, the relative modulation predicted by the exact L-HS solution
is 10.7\% larger than that predicted by the 1st order approximate L-HS
solution, while the solution that evaluates the long-wave orbital velocity
at the water surface rather than $z = 0$ is 38.4\% larger than that of the
1st order approximate L-HS solution.
Also, since the less-approximate solutions decrease the modulation in the
troughs and increase in on the crests, the average wavenumber modulation
is no longer 0, but 1\% in the case of the exact L-HS solution and 3.1\% in the
case of the extended solution.

  and the solid line shows the extended solution introduced in this paper.

\section{Apparent gravity}

Long waves also induce orbital acceleration under their surface, so the short
waves experience an apparent gravity:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:apparent_gravity1}
\widetilde{g} = g + \dfrac{\partial w_L}{\partial t}
\end{equation}
The positive sign in front of $\partial w_L/\partial t$ comes from our
coordinate-system convention where $w$ is defined positive-upward and $g$ is
defined positive-downward, and the fact that $\widetilde{g}$ is the apparent
gravity in the reference frame of the short waves.
Taking the long-wave vertical acceleration at the surface as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:w_L}
w_L = - a_L \omega_L e^{a_L k_L \cos{\psi}} \sin{\psi}
\end{equation}
we arrive at:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:apparent_gravity2}
\widetilde{g}(\psi) = g \left[
  1 - a_L k_L e^{a_L k_L \cos{\psi}} \left(
    \cos{\psi} + a_L k_L \sin^2{\psi}
  \right)
\right]
\end{equation}
The first-order term in $a_L k_L$ is in phase with the long-wave elevation,
so the apparent gravity of the short waves is increased at the long-wave crests
and decreased in the troughs.
The second-order term in $a_L k_L$ is positive-definite and phase-shifted by
$\pi/2$ relative to the crests.
The second-order term thus increases the apparent gravity on the front and rear
faces of the long wave (Fig. \ref{fig:apparent_gravity}).

\begin{figure}[h]
\label{fig:apparent_gravity}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/fig_gravity_modulation_by_phase.png}
\caption{
  Relative change in gravity of short waves due to a longer wave with steepness $a_L k_L = 0.2$,

With the new long-wave modulated expressions for the short-wave wavenumber
(Eq. \ref{eq:k_short3}) and gravity (Eq. \ref{eq:apparent_gravity2}), we can
evaluate the long-wave modulated frequency as simply
$\widetilde{\omega}(\psi) = \sqrt{\widetilde{g} \widetilde{k}}$, which we compare
for four different values of $a_L k_L$ in Fig. \ref{fig:frequency_modulation}.

\section{Lagrangian averaged short-wave properties}

Stokes drift is a residual Lagrangian drift that occurs due to the wave orbits
not being closed under a propagating wave
\cite{stokes1847,kenyon1969stokes,van2018stokes}:

\begin{equation}
\label{}
u_s = a^2 \omega k e^{2kz}
\end{equation}
for a monochromatic wave in deep water.
Stokes drift has been successfully used to predict material transport on the
ocean surface \cite{rohrs2012observation,curcic2016hurricane}.
It can be derived from linear wave theory by integrating the wave orbital
velocity following material orbits \cite{phillips1966dynamics}:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:lagrangian_average}
u_s = \overline{
  u(\psi) + 
  \zeta \dfrac{\partial u}{\partial x} +
  \xi \dfrac{\partial w}{\partial z}
}
\end{equation}
where $\zeta$ and $\xi$ are horizontal and vertical excursions of the orbits,
respectively.

To obtain an average modulation of the short-wave properties, we apply the same
Lagrangian integration approach used to obtain Stokes drift.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:stokes_wavenumber}
\widetilde{k_s} = \overline{
  \widetilde{k}(\psi) +
  \zeta \dfrac{\partial \widetilde{k}}{\partial x} +
  \xi \dfrac{\partial \widetilde{k}}{\partial z}
}
= k \left( 1 + a_L^2 k_L^2 \right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:stokes_gravity}
\widetilde{g_s} = \overline{
  \widetilde{g}(\psi) +
  \zeta \dfrac{\partial \widetilde{g}}{\partial x} +
  \xi \dfrac{\partial \widetilde{g}}{\partial z}
}
= g \left( 1 + \dfrac{3}{2} a_L^2 k_L^2 \right)
\end{equation}
