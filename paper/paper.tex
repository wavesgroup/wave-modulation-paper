\section{Introduction}

Short ocean surface waves are modulated by longer swell.
Following the result by \citeA{unna1941white,unna1942waves,unna1947sea},
\citeA{longuet1960changes} introduced an analytical solution for hydrodynamic
modulation of short waves by an underlying longer wave:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tau}
\widetilde{k} = k (1 + a_L k_L)
\end{equation}
where $\widetilde{k}$ and $k$ are the modulated and unmodulated wavenumbers of
short waves, respectively, and $a_L$ and $k_L$ are amplitude and wavenumber
of the long wave.

This result has been influential on the development of remote sensing of ocean
surface waves and currents \cite{keller1975microwave,hara1994hydrodynamic}
and has been used even recently \cite{peureux2021unsteady} to simulate
unsteady growth of short-waves due to longer waves.

In this study, we extend the \citeA{longuet1960changes} theory (hereafter L-HS)
to a higher-order solution following the linear wave theory, and present revised
phase-averaged estimates of short-wave properties in presence of long waves.

\section{Analytical solutions}

\subsection{Derivation of the original L-HS solution}

The L-HS solution can be most readily obtained by starting from the dispersion
relationship for short waves:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dispersion}
\omega = \sqrt{gk} + k U
\end{equation}
where $\omega$ is the angular frequency,
$g$ is the gravitational acceleration,
and $U$ is the mean advective current in the direction of the wave propagation.
For simplicity, we will limit the derivation to gravity waves and ignore
surface tension effects, however, the solution can be as well derived for
gravity-capillary waves by carrying the surface tension terms.

Next, take the conservation of wave crests:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:wave_crests1}
\dfrac{\partial k}{\partial t}
+ \dfrac{\partial \omega}{\partial x}
= 0
\end{equation}
where $\partial/\partial t$ and $\partial/\partial x$ are partial derivatives
in time and space, respectively.
Insert (\ref{eq:dispersion}) into (\ref{eq:wave_crests1}) to get:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:wave_crests2}
\dfrac{\partial k}{\partial t}
+ C_g \dfrac{\partial k}{\partial x}
+ U \dfrac{\partial k}{\partial x}
+ k \dfrac{\partial U}{\partial x}
= 0
\end{equation}
where $C_g$ is the group velocity of short waves.
At this step, we assume that $g$ does not vary in space and time.
We will see later that to a second order $g$ of short waves varies in presence
of long waves.
If we follow the short waves in a Lagrangian frame, we can re-write
(\ref{eq:wave_crests2}) as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:wave_crests3}
\dfrac{d k}{dt}
+ k \dfrac{\partial U}{\partial x}
= 0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:wave_crests4}
\dfrac{d k}{k}
= - \dfrac{\partial U}{\partial x} dt
\end{equation}
which states that the relative contraction of short waves is largest where the
convergence of the ambient current $U$ is the largest.
For short waves riding on longer waves, the mean ambient current is the
horizontal near-surface orbital velocity of the long wave.
Rather than at the long-wave surface, L-HS took the ambient current to be the
long-wave orbital velocity at the mean water level, $z = 0$:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:U_L1}
U = a_L \omega_L \cos{\psi}
\end{equation}
where $\psi$ is the long-wave phase such that the crest is located
at $\psi = 0$.
Insert (\ref{eq:U_L1}) into (\ref{eq:wave_crests4}) to obtain:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:wave_crests5}
\dfrac{d k}{k}
= a_L k_L \omega_L \sin{\psi} dt
\end{equation}
To calculate the long-wave modulated short-wave wavenumber, integrate
(\ref{eq:wave_crests5}) from the initial time at which the short-waves
are unperturbed (at $z=0$, or $\psi=\pi/2$), to time $t$:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:wave_crests6}
\int_k^{\ \widetilde k(t)} \dfrac{d k'}{k'}
= \int_0^t a_L k_L \omega_L \sin{\psi} dt'
\end{equation}
which yields:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:k_short1}
\ \widetilde k(\psi) = k e^{a_L k_L \cos{\psi}}
\end{equation}
Approximating (\ref{eq:k_short1}) to the first-order Taylor expansion,
we obtain the original L-HS solution:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:k_short2}
\ \widetilde k(\psi) = k (1 + a_L k_L \cos{\psi})
\end{equation}
The intuitive interpretation of (\ref{eq:k_short2}) is that as the short waves
contract on the front face of the long wave, they reach maximum contraction
(highest $\ \widetilde k$) at the crest of the long wave.
As they pass to the rear face of the long wave, they get elongated and reach
minimum contraction (lowest $\ \widetilde k$) in the trough of the long wave.

\subsection{Extending the L-HS solution}

L-HS made two approximations in their solution:
First, they evaluated the advective velocity of short waves at $z = 0$
rather than the surface, $z = \eta_L$, where $\eta_L$ is the long-wave
elevation; and second, they evaluated the solution to the first order
of the Taylor expansion series.
Both of these approximations cause an underestimate of the short-wave
modulation magnitude.

To extend the L-HS solution, evaluate the advective velocity at the surface
of the long-wave:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:U_L2}
U = U_L(z=\eta) = a_L \omega_L e^{a_L k_L \cos{\psi}} \cos{\psi}
\end{equation}
and insert it into \ref{eq:wave_crests4} to obtain:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:wave_crests7}
\dfrac{dk}{k} = a_L k_L \omega_L e^{a_L k_L \cos{\psi}} \sin{\psi} dt
\end{equation}
Integrate (\ref{eq:wave_crests7}) to the same limits as we did with
(\ref{eq:wave_crests6}) to obtain:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:k_short3}
\widetilde{k}(\psi) = k e^{a_L k_L \cos{\psi} e^{a_L k_L \cos{\psi}}}
\end{equation}

We compare the solutions from (\ref{eq:k_short1}), (\ref{eq:k_short2}),
and (\ref{eq:k_short3}) for a moderately steep long wave with steepness
$a_L k_L = 0.2$ in Fig. (\ref{fig:wavenumber_modulation}).
The original L-HS solution is a cosine wave with an amplitude equal
to the long-wave steepness.
The other two solutions both introduce an increase in wave modulation
on the crest and a decrease in the trough.
At the crest, the relative modulation predicted by the exact L-HS solution
is 10.7\% larger than that predicted by the 1st order approximate L-HS
solution, while the solution that evaluates the long-wave orbital velocity
at the water surface rather than $z = 0$ is 38.4\% larger than that of the
1st order approximate L-HS solution.
Also, since the less-approximate solutions decrease the modulation in the
troughs and increase in on the crests, the average wavenumber modulation
is no longer 0, but 1\% in the case of the exact L-HS solution and 3.1\% in the
case of the extended solution.

\section{Apparent gravity}

Long waves also induce orbital acceleration under their surface, so the short
waves experience an apparent gravity:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:apparent_gravity1}
\widetilde{g} = g + \dfrac{\partial w_L}{\partial t}
\end{equation}
The positive sign in front of $\partial w_L/\partial t$ comes from our
coordinate-system convention where $w$ is defined positive-upward and $g$ is
defined positive-downward, and the fact that $\widetilde{g}$ is the apparent
gravity in the reference frame of the short waves.
Taking the long-wave vertical acceleration at the surface as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:w_L}
w_L = - a_L \omega_L e^{a_L k_L \cos{\psi}} \sin{\psi}
\end{equation}
we arrive at:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:apparent_gravity2}
\widetilde{g}(\psi) = g \left[
  1 - a_L k_L e^{a_L k_L \cos{\psi}} \left(
    \cos{\psi} + a_L k_L \sin^2{\psi}
  \right)
\right]
\end{equation}
The first-order term in $a_L k_L$ is in phase with the long-wave elevation,
so the apparent gravity of the short waves is increased at the long-wave crests
and decreased in the troughs.
The second-order term in $a_L k_L$ is positive-definite and phase-shifted by
$\pi/2$ relative to the crests.
The second-order term thus increases the apparent gravity on the front and rear
faces of the long wave (Fig. \ref{fig:apparent_gravity}).

\begin{figure}[h]
\label{fig:apparent_gravity}

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/fig_gravity_modulation_by_phase.png}
\caption{

With the new long-wave modulated expressions for the short-wave wavenumber
(Eq. \ref{eq:k_short3}) and gravity (Eq. \ref{eq:apparent_gravity2}), we can
evaluate the long-wave modulated frequency as simply
$\widetilde{\omega}(\psi) = \sqrt{\widetilde{g} \widetilde{k}}$, which we compare
for four different values of $a_L k_L$ in Fig. \ref{fig:frequency_modulation}.

\section{Lagrangian averaged short-wave properties}

Stokes drift is a residual Lagrangian drift that occurs due to the wave orbits
not being closed under a propagating wave
\cite{stokes1847,kenyon1969stokes,van2018stokes}:

\begin{equation}
\label{}
u_s = a^2 \omega k e^{2kz}
\end{equation}
for a monochromatic wave in deep water.
Stokes drift has been successfully used to predict material transport on the
ocean surface \cite{rohrs2012observation,curcic2016hurricane}.
It can be derived from linear wave theory by integrating the wave orbital
velocity following material orbits \cite{phillips1966dynamics}:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:lagrangian_average}
u_s = \overline{
  u(\psi) + 
  \zeta \dfrac{\partial u}{\partial x} +
  \xi \dfrac{\partial w}{\partial z}
}
\end{equation}
where $\zeta$ and $\xi$ are horizontal and vertical excursions of the orbits,
respectively.

To obtain an average modulation of the short-wave properties, we apply the same
Lagrangian integration approach used to obtain Stokes drift.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:stokes_wavenumber}
\widetilde{k_s} = \overline{
  \widetilde{k}(\psi) +
  \zeta \dfrac{\partial \widetilde{k}}{\partial x} +
  \xi \dfrac{\partial \widetilde{k}}{\partial z}
}
= k \left( 1 + a_L^2 k_L^2 \right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:stokes_gravity}
\widetilde{g_s} = \overline{
  \widetilde{g}(\psi) +
  \zeta \dfrac{\partial \widetilde{g}}{\partial x} +
  \xi \dfrac{\partial \widetilde{g}}{\partial z}
}
= g \left( 1 + \dfrac{3}{2} a_L^2 k_L^2 \right)
\end{equation}
