\begin{abstract}
Hydrodynamic modulation of short ocean surface waves by longer ambient waves is
a well-known ocean surface process that pertains to remote sensing, the
interpretation of in situ wave measurements, and numerical wave forecasting.
In this paper we revisit the early analytical work by \citeA{longuet1960changes},
as well as the more recent numerical simulations by \citeA{peureux2021unsteady},
to re-evaluate the changes in short-wave properties due to the presence of longer waves.
We present two distinct improvements to the current state of the art:
First, we derive a higher-order, non-linear solution for the short-wave wavenumber
and action density as function of the long-wave phase and steepness.
This solution suggests an increase in short-wave wavenumber by 18 and 38\% for
long-wave steepenesses of 0.1 and 0.2, respectively, compared to the original
linear solution.
It is also in close agreement with the full numerical solutions up to the
long-wave steepness of 0.25.
Second, we find that the full numerical solutions, which were previously found
to be unstable for homogeneous initial conditions, are in fact stable for more
realistic long-wave groups.
The key physical interpretation from these results is that the short waves can
indefinitely grow and steepen only in the presence of inifinite long-wave trains,
an unlikely occurence in the ocean.
\end{abstract}

\section*{Plain Language Summary}
The ocean surface is typically covered by waves of many wavelengths.
Longer waves bunch up and dilate the shorter waves, and this process is
important to consider for both the measurements and the forecasting of ocean
waves.
Although there have been analytical and numerical solutions for how the short
waves should change in the presence of longer waves, they have been simplified
and incomplete.
This paper revisits and extends these solutions to propose a more accurate
description of how the short waves should change in the presence of longer
waves.

\section{Introduction}

Short ocean surface waves are modulated by longer swell.
Following the result by \citeA{unna1941white,unna1942waves,unna1947sea},
\citeA{longuet1960changes} introduced an analytical solution for hydrodynamic
modulation of short waves at the crest of an underlying longer wave:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tau}
\widetilde{k} = k (1 + a_L k_L)
\end{equation}
where $\widetilde{k}$ and $k$ are the modulated and unmodulated wavenumbers of
short waves, respectively, and $a_L$ and $k_L$ are amplitude and wavenumber
of the long wave, respectively.
This result has been influential on the development of remote sensing of ocean
surface waves and currents \cite{keller1975microwave,hara1994hydrodynamic}
and has been used even recently \cite{peureux2021unsteady} to simulate
unsteady growth of short-waves due to longer waves.

TODO extend with background.

In this study, we extend the \citeA{longuet1960changes} theory (hereafter L-HS)
to a higher-order solution following the linear wave theory, and present revised
phase-averaged estimates of short-wave properties in presence of long waves. 

\section{Governing equations}

In this paper we consider inviscid, irrotational, and incompressible flow.
In these conditions the linear (sine-like), deep-water, surface gravity waves
obey the dispersion relation:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dispersion}
\omega = \sqrt{gk} + k U
\end{equation}
where $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $g$ is the gravitational acceleration,
$k$ is the wavenumber, and $U$ is the mean advective current in the direction
of the wave propagation.
A current in the direction of the waves thus increases its absolution frequency,
wavenumber remaining unchanged.
An important limitation here is that $U$ must be slow-varying on the scales of
the wave period \cite{bretherton1968wavetrains}.
In the context of short waves riding on long waves, the mean advective current
is the horizontal near-surface orbital velocity of the long wave.

The second important relation is the conservation of wave crests:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:wave_crests}
\dfrac{\partial k}{\partial t}
+ \dfrac{\partial \omega}{\partial x}
= 0
\end{equation}
where $t$ and $x$ are time and space, respectively.
This relation states that the wavenumber must change when the frequency varies
in space.

Equations (\ref{eq:dispersion}) and (\ref{eq:wave_crests}) only describe the
evolution of the short-wave wavenumber.
To describe the evolution of the wave amplitude, we use the conservation of wave
action in absence of sources (e.g. due to wind) and sinks (e.g. due to whitecapping):

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:wave_action}
\dfrac{\partial N}{\partial t}
+ \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x} \left[\left(C_g + U\right)N\right]
= 0
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the action density, and $C_g = \partial \omega / \partial k$ is the
group speed.
In deep water, the group speed is half the phase speed, so $C_g = 1/2\sqrt{g/k}$.

As the short waves ride on the surface of the long wave,
they move in an accelerated reference frame and will thus experience effective
gravitational acceleration that changes in both space and time \cite{longuet1986eulerian,longuet1987propagation}.
Inserting Eq. (\ref{eq:dispersion}) into (\ref{eq:wave_action}) we obtain:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:wavenumber}
\dfrac{\partial k}{\partial t}
+ \left(C_g + U\right) \dfrac{\partial k}{\partial x}
+ k \dfrac{\partial U}{\partial x}
+ \dfrac{1}{2} \sqrt{\dfrac{k}{g}} \dfrac{\partial g}{\partial x}
= 0
\end{equation}
From left to right, the terms in this equation represent the change in wavenumber
due to the propagation and advection by ambient current $U$, the convergence of
the ambient current, and the spatial inhomogeneity of the gravitational acceleration.
In a non-accelerated reference frame (i.e. in absence of longer waves), the last
term is zero.
However, if gravitational acceleration varies in space, this term is necessary
to conserve the wave crests.

Similar to Eq. \ref{eq:wavenumber}, we expand Eq. \ref{eq:wave_action} to obtain:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:wave_action2}
\dfrac{\partial N}{\partial t}
+ \left(C_g + U\right) \dfrac{\partial N}{\partial x}
+ N \dfrac{\partial U}{\partial x}
+ N \dfrac{\partial C_g}{\partial x}
= 0
\end{equation}
This equation is similar to Eq. \ref{eq:wavenumber}, except for the last term
which here represents the inhomogeneity of the group speed.
As \citeA{peureux2021unsteady} explained, this term is responsible for unstable
growth of wave action in infinite long-wave trains.
Eqs. \ref{eq:wavenumber} and \ref{eq:wave_action2} will be the governing equations
that we solve numerically in section \ref{section:numerical_solutions}.

For the ambient forcing, we consider a train of monochromatic long wave
defined, to the first order in steepness, by the elevation $\eta_L = a_L cos{\psi}$,
where $a_L$ is the long-wave amplitude, $\psi = k_L x - \omega_L t$ is the
long-wave phase, and $\omega_L$ its angular frequency.

At this time we define the long-wave steepness $\varepsilon_L = a_L k_L$ which
we will use thoughout the rest of the paper as a scaling parameter.
The long wave induces horizontal and vertical orbital velocities whose values
at the surface $\eta_L$ are:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:U_L}
U = a_L \omega_L e^{\varepsilon_L \cos{\psi}} \cos{\psi}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:w_L}
W = a_L \omega_L e^{\varepsilon_L \cos{\psi}} \sin{\psi}
\end{equation}

Eqs. \ref{eq:dispersion}-\ref{eq:w_L} is the full system of equations that we
exploit in the remainder of this paper.

\section{Analytical solutions}
\label{section:analytical_solutions}

\subsection{Wavenumber and amplitude modulation}
\label{subsection:analytical_solutions}

Solving analytically for the wavenumber requires dropping spatial gradients of
$k$ in Eq. \ref{eq:wavenumber} and assuming homogeneous $g$:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:wavenumber2}
\dfrac{\partial k}{\partial t}
= - k \dfrac{\partial U}{\partial x}
\end{equation}
Although \citeA{peureux2021unsteady} pointed out that the solution by L-HS
requires assuming homogeneous group speed of the short-wave field, in fact,
it also requires assuming no horizontal propagation and advection of the short
waves.
Combining Eqs. \ref{eq:U_L} and \ref{eq:wavenumber2}, and integrating it in time
yields:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:k_short_exact}
\widetilde{k}(\psi) = k e^{\varepsilon_L \cos{\psi} e^{\varepsilon_L \cos{\psi}}}
\end{equation}

Notice that the Taylor expansion of Eq. \ref{eq:k_short_exact} to the first order
recovers the original solution by L-HS:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:k_short_lhs}
\widetilde{k}(\psi) = k (1 + \varepsilon_L \cos{\psi})
\end{equation}

The L-HS solution requires two approximations in their solution:
First, evaluating the long-wave velocity at $z = 0$
rather than $z = \eta_L$; and second, evaluating the solution to the first order
of the Taylor expansion series.
Both of these approximations cause an underestimate of the short-wave
modulation magnitude (Fig. \ref{fig:wavenumber_modulation}).
The original L-HS solution is a cosine wave with an amplitude equal
to the long-wave steepness.
The other two solutions both introduce an increase in wave modulation
on the crest and a decrease in the trough.
At the crest, the relative modulation predicted by the exact L-HS solution
is 10.7\% larger than that predicted by the 1st order approximate L-HS
solution, while the solution that evaluates the long-wave orbital velocity
at the water surface rather than $z = 0$ is 38.4\% larger than that of the
1st order approximate L-HS solution.

  and the solid line shows the extended solution introduced in this paper.

\end{figure}

TODO amplitude modulation;

\subsection{Gravity modulation}
\label{subsection:gravity_modulation}

Long waves induce vertical orbital accelerations, so the short
waves that ride on their surface move in an accelerated reference frame and
experience effective gravitational acceleration that is lower at the crests and
higher in the troughs \cite{longuet1986eulerian,longuet1987propagation}.
A linearized (sine-like) wave has a modulation in gravity acceleration at its
surface:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:effective_gravity}
\widetilde{g}(\psi) = g + \dfrac{\partial W}{\partial t} = g \left[
  1 - \varepsilon_L e^{\varepsilon_L \cos{\psi}} \left(
    \cos{\psi} - \varepsilon_L \sin^2{\psi}
  \right)
\right]
\end{equation}
The first-order term in $a_L k_L$ is in phase with the long-wave elevation,
so the apparent gravity of the short waves is increased at the long-wave crests
and decreased in the troughs.
The second-order term in $a_L k_L$ is positive-definite and phase-shifted by
$\pi/2$ relative to the crests.
The second-order term thus increases the apparent gravity on the front and rear
faces of the long wave (Fig. \ref{fig:apparent_gravity}).

\begin{figure}[h]
\label{fig:gravity_modulation}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/fig_gravity_modulation_2panel.png}
\caption{
  Relative change in gravity of short waves due to a longer wave with steepness $a_L k_L = 0.2$,
  as a function of the long-wave phase and evaluated to the first (dashed line) and second (solid line) order in $a_L k_L$.
}
\end{figure}

With the new long-wave modulated expressions for the short-wave wavenumber
(Eq. \ref{eq:k_short3}) and gravity (Eq. \ref{eq:apparent_gravity2}), we can
evaluate the long-wave modulated frequency as simply
$\widetilde{\omega}(\psi) = \sqrt{\widetilde{g} \widetilde{k}}$, which we compare
for four different values of $a_L k_L$ in Fig. \ref{fig:frequency_modulation}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\label{fig:frequency_modulation}

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/fig_frequency_modulation_2panel.png}
\caption{

  waves, for four different values of long-wave steepness.
}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Frequency and group speed modulation}

\subsection{Lagrangian averaged short-wave properties}

Stokes drift is a residual Lagrangian drift that occurs due to the wave orbits
not being closed under a propagating wave
\cite{stokes1847,kenyon1969stokes,van2018stokes}:

\begin{equation}
\label{}
u_s = a^2 \omega k e^{2kz}
\end{equation}
for a monochromatic wave in deep water.
Stokes drift has been successfully used to predict material transport on the
ocean surface \cite{rohrs2012observation,curcic2016hurricane}.
It can be derived from linear wave theory by integrating the wave orbital
velocity following material orbits \cite{phillips1966dynamics}:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:lagrangian_average}
u_s = \overline{
  u(\psi) + 
  \zeta \dfrac{\partial u}{\partial x} +
  \xi \dfrac{\partial w}{\partial z}
}
\end{equation}
where $\zeta$ and $\xi$ are horizontal and vertical excursions of the orbits,
respectively.

To obtain an average modulation of the short-wave properties, we apply the same
Lagrangian integration approach used to obtain Stokes drift.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:stokes_wavenumber}
\widetilde{k_s} = \overline{
  \widetilde{k}(\psi) +
  \zeta \dfrac{\partial \widetilde{k}}{\partial x} +
  \xi \dfrac{\partial \widetilde{k}}{\partial z}
}
= k \left( 1 + a_L^2 k_L^2 \right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:stokes_gravity}
\widetilde{g_s} = \overline{
  \widetilde{g}(\psi) +
  \zeta \dfrac{\partial \widetilde{g}}{\partial x} +
  \xi \dfrac{\partial \widetilde{g}}{\partial z}
}
= g \left( 1 + \dfrac{3}{2} a_L^2 k_L^2 \right)
\end{equation}

\section{Numerical solutions}
\label{section:numerical_solutions}

We now proceed to integrate the full numerical solutions for the short-wave
wavenumber and action density in presence of long waves.
Equations (\ref{eq:wavenumber})-(\ref{eq:wave_action2}) are discretized using
2nd order central finite difference in space and integrated in time using the
4th order Runge-Kutta method \cite{butcher1996runge}.
Although the 2nd order central finite difference is not appropriate for many
numerical problems, in our case it is sufficient because it is conservative and
the fields that we compute derivatives of are smooth and continuous.
The space is divided into 100 grid points.

\section{Scale analysis}
\label{section:scale_analysis}

Now that we showed that the analytical solution is consistent with full numerical
solutions for $\varepsilon_L < 0.25$, we can use analytical solutions for scale
analysis to quantify the relative contribution of tendencies in the full equation set.
